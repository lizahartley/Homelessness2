                <h2>Jimmy's Feminine Health Project</h2>

                <p>Jimmy's Cambridge is a homelessness charity based on East Road. This year they have launched the Feminine Helth Project for female rough sleepers.
                  The aim is to help women on the streets access sanitary products for free and to help rough sleepers avoid the health and wellbeing risks associated with homelessness.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p> Jimmy's and certain locations around the city, now provide free sanitary products for homeless women and peope of female bodies.<p>
                    <p>This map details where you can get free menstrual supplies and hand sanitizer. Check out below to find out why!</p>

                    <p>Having access to menstrual products gives homeless women back their dignity and independence, but it also protects from Toxic Shock Syndrome.
                    Symptoms of Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS) include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>the whites of the eyes, lips and tongue turning a bright red</li>
                    <li> a high temperature (fever) of 39C (102.2F) or above</li>
                    <li>flu-like symptoms, such as a headache, chills, muscle aches, a sore throat and a cough</li>
                    <li class='important'>sickness and diarrhoea</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Mythbusting About Homelessness</h2>

                <p>Homeless people are sometimes stereotyped as all being dangerous, addicted to substances or too lazy to hold down a job. This is NOT TRUE. There are lots of reasons someone might become homeless</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Myth #1: "People experiencing homelessness choose to be homeless" Most people become homeless because of economic circumstances, such as unemployment or the inability to afford rising living costs, according to a Homeless in Canada report. “It’s degrading and stigmatizing to be homeless,” says Dr. Stephen Gaetz, director of the Canadian Observatory on Homelessness. “There’s an incredible lack of safety, you’re more likely to be malnourished, you’re more likely to be a victim of crime, you’re more likely to be sexually assaulted, your health worsens, your mental health worsens. If you take a chronically homeless person [and] offer them housing with support, they’ll generally stay in housing.”</li>
                    <li>Myth #2: "It’s their own fault they’re homeless" While it’s hard to pinpoint a “cause” of homelessness, most people end up experiencing homelessness because of poverty, according to the Homeless in Canada report. And poverty is affected by complex issues such as lifelong trauma, family breakdown or mental health issues, according to Alex Cheng, client services director with Blue Door Shelters, a United Way-supported agency in York Region that provides emergency housing for youth, families and adult men. “We see a lot of folks that have a mental health diagnosis or use substances to self-medicate, and those are all barriers for individuals who are homeless to move forward.”</li>
                    <li>Myth #3: This would never happen to me" Homelessness can happen to anyone, A lot of people are one paycheque away from being homeless. … We see that a lot with families — because of finances or job loss or extenuating circumstances, the entire family becomes homeless.
                      <br>
                      The first step in tackling unignorable issues like homelessness, is understanding them. Acknowledging that these myths are, in fact, myths, can help to reduce stigma, increase empathy and move people out of homelessness.</li>
